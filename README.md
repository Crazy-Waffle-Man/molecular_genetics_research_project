# Genetic Repair python project
This project aims to illustrate different methods of genetic repair. It is a set of two python classes that will determine if a damaged DNA strand even has a chance of being repaired, and also what it will be transcribed and translated to. This will help researchers to avoid using exensive reagents on genetic repair that doesn't have a chance of working by allowing them to do a rough simulation first.

It is compatible with Pygame zero, but if you don't want to render it, you only need molecular_genetics.py.

If you want to render, you need pgone.py and pygame zero. There are also images in images/sprites that are required.

# Dependencies
If you have pgone.py and you see a ModuleNotFoundError, that is probably because you don't have [pygame zero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) installed.
